:warning: Avoid running this tool without a YubiKey present as it will then lock your computer.

### Default behavior
sciber-yklocker will check if htere is a YubiKey present every 10 seconds, and if there is not the computer will be locked.

On Windows this will only happen if the proper register values are set - otherwise it defaults to doNothing.

## Installation
### Windows
1. Download the installer sciber-yklocker.msi from [releases](https://github.com/sciber-io/yklocker/releases)
2. Run the installer (installs the service SciberYklocker for you)
#### Set registry values
1. Download the .admx and .adml files from the "Administrative template" folder
2. Intune/GPO: Follow Jonas guide on his blog: https://swjm.blog/locking-the-workstation-on-fido2-security-key-removal-part-2-80962c944c78 to set up GPO/Intune control to decide what you want to do if the YubiKey is removed.
3. (Locally: download the amdx and adml file to your computer and place them in C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions, then start local group policy editor -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Sciber Yklocker Settings --> turn on to get registry values)


### Linux
