# YubiKey Autolocker by Sciber

To enable automatic lock when removing the YubiKey.

### Comandline options (ALL OS's)
```bash
# Defaults to LOCKOUT, can be set to LOGOUT with
sciber-yklocker.exe -l logout

# Defaults to checking for a yubikey every 10 seconds, can be changed with
sciber-yklocker.exe -t 20
```

### Windows
1. Download the installer sciber-yklocker.msi from [releases](https://github.com/sciber-io/yklocker/releases)
2. Run the installer (installs the service SciberYklocker for you)
3. Follow Jonas guide on his blog: https://swjm.blog/locking-the-workstation-on-fido2-security-key-removal-part-2-80962c944c78 to set up GPO/Intune control to decide what you want to do if the YubiKey is removed.

```bash
# Change behavior on Windows via the registry:
# removalOptions: lock,logout
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Yubico\YubiKey Removal Behavior
  - removalOption lock
  - timeout 10
```

### Linux
Download sciber-yklocker.linux and execute it in a terminal (requires you to keep that terminal window open).

### Mac
Download sciber-yklocker.darwin and execute it in a terminal (requires you to keep that terminal window open).
- Only supports lockout

### Warning
Avoid running this tool without a YubiKey present as it will then lock your computer.
