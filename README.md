# YubiKey Autolocker by Sciber

To enable automatic lock when removing the YubiKey.

### Comandline options (Linux and MAC)
```bash
# [Optional] Set removalOption - defaults to Lock
-l Lock|Logout|doNothing

# [Optional] Set timeout - defaults to 10 seconds
-t 20
```

### Windows
1. Download the installer sciber-yklocker.msi from [releases](https://github.com/sciber-io/yklocker/releases)
2. Run the installer (installs the service SciberYklocker for you)
3. Follow Jonas guide on his blog: https://swjm.blog/locking-the-workstation-on-fido2-security-key-removal-part-2-80962c944c78 to set up GPO/Intune control to decide what you want to do if the YubiKey is removed.

```bash
# Change behavior on Windows via the registry:
# removalOptions: Lock,Logout,doNothing
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Yubico\YubiKey Removal Behavior
  - removalOption lock
  - timeout 10
```

### Linux
Download sciber-yklocker.linux and execute it in a terminal (requires you to keep that terminal window open).

### Mac
Download sciber-yklocker.darwin and execute it in a terminal (requires you to keep that terminal window open).
- Only supports lockout

### Warning
Avoid running this tool without a YubiKey present as it will then lock your computer.
